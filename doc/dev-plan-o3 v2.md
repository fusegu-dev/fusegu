## ‚ùì Clarifying Questions

Before locking in the architecture, it would help to know:

1. **Typical Throughput & Latency Targets**

   * How many events per second (peak & sustained) do you expect, and what is the maximum acceptable p99 response time?
2. **Data Residency / Compliance**

   * Must the service support regional data-in-place (e.g., EU-only storage) or multitenant isolation?
3. **Reference Data Sources**

   * Will you maintain your own IP-reputation/device data, or integrate with commercial feeds (e.g., Spamhaus, SEON)?
4. **Preferred Model-Training Stack**

   * Are you happy with an external Python pipeline, or do you want a Rust-only ML workflow?
5. **Rule-Authoring Personas**

   * Will non-technical analysts write rules, or is the DSL aimed at engineers only?
6. **Real-Time Feature Store vs. Batch**

   * Do you need low-latency counters (‚â§ 100 ms) or is hourly batch aggregation sufficient?
7. **Deployment Footprint**

   * Kubernetes assumed, or should the service also run on edge/WASM or serverless (AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers)?

Feel free to answer any (or none) of these; I‚Äôll revise assumptions in the next draft.

## üîç Self-Critique of the Initial Plan

| Area                      | Weakness / Missing Piece                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability specifics** | I quoted performance goals (‚Äú10 000 rules < 2 ms‚Äù) without backing them up with load-test methodology or cluster sizing guidelines. |
| **Schema & versioning**   | No concrete JSON schema examples; OpenAPI mention is abstract. Breaking-change strategy for event formats isn‚Äôt outlined.           |
| **Testing strategy**      | Unit/integration testing, golden datasets, and chaos testing (network partitions, corrupt messages) are absent.                     |
| **Security posture**      | Mentioned HMAC & mTLS but skipped threat modelling (e.g., abuse of the feedback endpoint) and secrets management (KMS, Vault).      |
| **Fairness & bias**       | ML section ignores disparate impact analysis and bias monitoring‚Äîa growing compliance requirement.                                  |
| **Dev-experience**        | No local dev story (Docker compose, mock feature store) or example client SDK usage.                                                |
| **Ops & resilience**      | Lacked details on disaster recovery (multi-AZ), blue-green/canary rollout mechanics, and auto-scaling triggers.                     |
| **Cost awareness**        | No cost model or guidance on minimizing Redis/Kafka/Postgres spend for smaller adopters.                                            |
| **Edge/embedded**         | Briefly hinted at WASM, but without describing size/latency trade-offs or a subset feature set.                                     |

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Regenerated Plan (v2 Draft)

> **Assumptions** (until clarified):
> ‚Ä¢ Throughput 5 k RPS peak, p99 < 150 ms.
> ‚Ä¢ Kubernetes deployment; Postgres + Redis available.
> ‚Ä¢ Python accepted for offline training.
> ‚Ä¢ Rule authors are a mix of analysts & engineers.

### 0. High-Level Goals

* **Multi-layer fraud scoring** (rules + ML) delivered as a single Rust micro-service.
* **Simple to adopt** on a laptop, yet linearly scalable in K8s.
* **Transparent & auditable** (reason codes, SHAP, signed rule commits).
* **Compliant** with GDPR, PDPA, PCI DSS SAQ-A.

### 1. Data & API Design

| Topic               | v2 Decision                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event schema**    | Canonical `Transaction` object (<200 fields, JSON Schema 2020-12). Major versions in URI; minor versions via `x-minor-v` header.                |
| **OpenAPI**         | Generated by `utoipa` ‚Üí published at `/docs/openapi.yaml`; includes example payloads & error objects.                                           |
| **Batch ingest**    | `POST /v1/events/bulk?async=true` ‚Üí returns job-id; progress via SSE.                                                                           |
| **Real-time score** | `POST /v1/score` returns:<br>`risk`: 0‚Äì100,<br>`layers`: { `rules`: 17, `model`: 42 },<br>`reasons`: array of structs `{code, weight, message}` |
| **Feedback**        | Separate API key scope **‚Äúfeedback-write‚Äù**; events older than 60 days rejected.                                                                |

---

### 2. Rules Engine (v2)

* **DSL v0.2** ‚Äî YAML or JSON, but also expose a **low-code UI** (Monaco-based) with linting & unit-test runner.
* **Execution** ‚Äî Compile rules to a **Rust enum dispatcher** (proc-macro) at build-time to avoid runtime parsing.
* **Stateful clauses** ‚Äî Sliding-window counters backed by Redis Streams; default retention 7 days.
* **Governance** ‚Äî Rules live in a Git repo; each deploy bundles a signed manifest (Sigstore).
* **Testing** ‚Äî CI runs rule regression tests against golden events and synthetic fuzzers.

### 3. ML Engine (v2)

| Step                | Detail                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feature store**   | **Redis & DuckDB hybrid**:<br>‚Ä¢ Redis for sub-second counters (IP velocity).<br>‚Ä¢ DuckDB-Parquet lake for historical joins in training. |
| **Training**        | Python + Polars pipeline; LightGBM & CatBoost ‚Üí exported to **ONNX** + calibration (Platt scaling).                                     |
| **Serving**         | **onnxruntime-rust** with pre-allocated arenas; p95 inference < 0.5 ms on x86\_64.                                                      |
| **Drift & bias**    | Daily job computes PSI/KS & fairness metrics; alerts via Prometheus Alertmanager.                                                       |
| **Retraining loop** | Async label capture triggers weekly automated retrain; canary served to 5 % of traffic via header flag.                                 |

### 4. Platform & Operations

* **Deployment artefacts** ‚Äî Multi-arch OCI images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `wasm32-wasi` subset).
* **Helm chart** with optional sub-charts (Postgres, Redis); sensible defaults for single-node dev.
* **Observability** ‚Äî OpenTelemetry ‚Üí Grafana Tempo; structured logs; Grafana dashboards pre-baked.
* **Resilience** ‚Äî

  * Stateless API pods behind HPA (CPU and queue lag).
  * Readiness checks ensure rule/model loaded.
  * Blue-green via Helm hooks; rollback < 5 s.
* **Cost tiers** ‚Äî Doc page with ‚Äúsmall‚Äù, ‚Äústandard‚Äù, ‚ÄúXL‚Äù templates and projected cloud cost.

### 5. Security & Compliance

* **AuthN** ‚Äî HMAC (server-side secret rotation) + optional OAuth 2.1 client-credentials.
* **AuthZ** ‚Äî Policy-based (OPA sidecar) or compile-time RBAC feature flag.
* **Secrets** ‚Äî CSI driver for Vault/KMS.
* **PII handling** ‚Äî Field-level AES-GCM encryption; deterministic tokenisation for email/phone.
* **Audit trail** ‚Äî Immutable append-only log (WORM S3) of rule changes, data access, scoring.
* **Right-to-explain** ‚Äî `/v1/reports/{id}?format=pdf` generates a GDPR-compliant report with SHAP plots.
