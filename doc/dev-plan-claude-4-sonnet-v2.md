# Clarifying Questions

Before finalizing the architecture, I need to understand several key aspects:

## 📊 Scale & Performance
1. **Expected Load**: What's your target throughput? Are you aiming for hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of requests per second?
2. **Latency Requirements**: Is sub-100ms critical, or is 200-500ms acceptable for the MVP?
3. **Geographic Distribution**: Single region deployment or multi-region from day one?

## 🏢 Business & Users
4. **Primary Users**: Are you targeting enterprise customers, SMBs, or developers/SaaS platforms?
5. **Monetization Model**: Will this be purely open source, open core, or SaaS offering?
6. **Compliance Needs**: Which regulations are critical (GDPR, PCI DSS, SOX, specific industry requirements)?

## 🔧 Technical Constraints
7. **ML Training Infrastructure**: Do you have existing ML infrastructure, or should this be cloud-agnostic?
8. **Deployment Preferences**: Kubernetes-first, or should it also work on bare metal/VMs?
9. **Integration Patterns**: Will users primarily use REST APIs, or do you need SDKs, webhooks, streaming?

## 💰 Resource Constraints
10. **Development Team Size**: How many developers will work on this initially?
11. **Infrastructure Budget**: Any preferences for minimizing cloud costs in early stages?
12. **Timeline Pressure**: Is there a hard deadline or funding milestone to hit?

# 🔍 Self-Critique of My Initial Plan

## Major Issues

| Problem Area | Specific Issues |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Overengineering** | Jumped straight to enterprise-scale architecture with ClickHouse, complex ML pipelines, and microservices without validating core value proposition first |
| **Timeline Unrealistic** | 6-month timeline for a full-featured fraud detection platform is extremely aggressive, especially with ML components |
| **Missing MVP Definition** | No clear definition of minimum viable product - what's the smallest thing that provides value? |
| **Technology Complexity** | Introduced too many moving parts (PostgreSQL + ClickHouse + Redis + ML training pipeline) before proving product-market fit |
| **Open Source Strategy** | Didn't address community building, contribution guidelines, or how to balance open source with potential commercial aspects |
| **Data Privacy Gaps** | Mentioned GDPR compliance but didn't detail data retention, right to deletion, or cross-border data transfer |
| **Cost Blindness** | No consideration of infrastructure costs for users, especially smaller organizations |
| **Testing Strategy** | Mentioned testing but no concrete strategy for validating fraud detection accuracy |
| **ML Training Reality** | Assumed availability of labeled fraud data without addressing cold start problem |

## Architectural Flaws

### 1. **Data Architecture Overcomplexity**
- Starting with both PostgreSQL AND ClickHouse is overkill for MVP
- Redis as feature store adds unnecessary complexity
- No clear data retention or cleanup strategy

### 2. **ML Pipeline Premature**
- Assumes you have quality labeled data from day one
- ONNX runtime adds complexity without proven need
- No strategy for handling model drift or retraining

### 3. **Rule Engine Overdesign**
- YAML DSL is fine, but the "low-code UI" is scope creep
- Hot-reloading adds operational complexity
- No clear migration strategy for rule changes

### 4. **Missing Operational Concerns**
- No disaster recovery plan
- Unclear backup/restore procedures
- No capacity planning guidance
- Missing security threat model

# 🔄 Regenerated Plan v2: MVP-First Approach

## 🎯 Revised Philosophy: Start Simple, Scale Smart

**Core Principle**: Build the simplest possible fraud detection system that provides real value, then iterate based on user feedback.

---

## 🥇 Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-3)
### Goal: Deployable fraud detection that beats "no fraud detection"

### Architecture: Monolith + PostgreSQL + Redis
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[REST API Client] --> B[FuseGu API Server]
    B --> C[(PostgreSQL)]
    B --> D[(Redis Cache)]
    B --> E[Rule Engine]
    E --> F[Simple Scoring]
    
    subgraph "Single Rust Binary"
        B
        E
        F
    end
```

### Core Features
1. **Single REST Endpoint**: `POST /v1/score`
2. **Basic Rule Engine**: 10-15 hardcoded fraud patterns
3. **Simple Scoring**: Weighted rule combinations (no ML)
4. **PostgreSQL**: Transaction logs + rule configs
5. **Redis**: IP/email velocity counters only

### Rule Engine v1: Rust Enums (No DSL)
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum FraudRule {
    HighVelocityIP { window_minutes: u32, threshold: u32 },
    SuspiciousEmailDomain { domains: Vec<String> },
    LargeAmount { threshold: f64 },
    GeoMismatch { max_distance_km: f64 },
    NewUserHighAmount { days_threshold: u32, amount_threshold: f64 },
}

impl FraudRule {
    pub async fn evaluate(&self, txn: &Transaction, store: &FeatureStore) -> Option<RuleHit> {
        match self {
            FraudRule::HighVelocityIP { window_minutes, threshold } => {
                let count = store.get_ip_count(&txn.ip, *window_minutes).await?;
                if count > *threshold {
                    Some(RuleHit { 
                        rule: "high_velocity_ip",
                        score: 25.0,
                        reason: format!("IP {} had {} transactions in {}min", txn.ip, count, window_minutes)
                    })
                } else { None }
            }
            // ... other rules
        }
    }
}
```

### Simplified API Response
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_123",
  "risk_score": 23.5,
  "risk_level": "medium",
  "disposition": "review",
  "rule_hits": [
    {
      "rule": "high_velocity_ip", 
      "score": 15.0,
      "reason": "IP 1.2.3.4 had 12 transactions in 60min"
    },
    {
      "rule": "suspicious_email",
      "score": 8.5, 
      "reason": "Email domain 10minutemail.com is disposable"
    }
  ],
  "processing_time_ms": 23
}
```

### Success Criteria

```toml
# Cargo.toml - Keep it simple
[dependencies]
axum = "0.7"

## 🔒 Security-First Approach

### Built-in Security (All Phases)
1. **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, CORS
2. **Data Security**: Encryption at rest/transit, PII tokenization
3. **Access Control**: API key scoping, role-based permissions
4. **Audit**: All actions logged with immutable audit trail
5. **Compliance**: GDPR deletion, data export, retention policies

### Security Testing
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod security_tests {
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_sql_injection_protection() {
        // Ensure parameterized queries prevent injection
    }
    
    #[tokio::test] 
    async fn test_rate_limiting() {
        // Verify rate limits are enforced
    }
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_pii_tokenization() {
        // Ensure PII is properly tokenized
    }
}
```

This revised plan focuses on building something real and deployable quickly, then iterating based on actual user needs rather than trying to build everything at once.
